# Market Efficiency
## Key Questions
- What is consumer surplus?  How is it related to the demand curve?
- What is producer surplus?  How is it related to the supply curve?
- Do markets produce a desirable allocation of resources?  Or could the market outcome be improved upon? 

## Welfare Economics
- Recall, the **allocation of resources** refers to:
	- how much of each good is produced
	- which producers produce it
	- which consumers consume it
- **Welfare economics** studies how the allocation of resources affects economic well-being.

## Willingness to Pay
- A buyer’s **willingness to pay** for a good is the maximum amount the buyer will pay for that good.
- WTP measures how much the buyer values the good.

## Consumer Surplus
- **Consumer surplus** is the amount a buyer is willing to pay minus the amount the buyer actually pays:
$CS=WTP–P$

## CS with Lots of Buyers
- CS is the area b/w $P$  and the $D$ curve, from $0$ to $Q$. 
- Recall:  area of  a triangle equals  $\frac{1}{2} \times$ base $\times$ height

- $CS = \frac{1}{2} \times 15 \times \$30  = \$225.$
- If $P$ rises to $\$40$, $CS = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times \$20  = \$100.$

## Cost and the Supply Curve
- **Cost** is the value of everything a seller must give up to produce a good (i.e., opportunity cost).  
- Includes cost of all resources used to produce good, including value of the seller’s time.  

## PS with Lots of Sellers
- PS is the area b/w  $P$  and the $S$ curve, from $0$ to $Q$.

- So,  
$PS = \frac{1}{2} \times 25 \times \$25 =\$312.50$

## CS, PS, and Total Surplus
- CS  = (value to buyers) – (amount paid by buyers) = buyers’ gains from participating in the market
- PS  = (amount received by sellers) – (cost to sellers) = sellers’ gains from participating in the market
- **Total surplus** = CS + PS = total gains from trade in a market = (value to buyers) – (cost to sellers)

## The Market’s Allocation of Resources
- In a market economy, the allocation of resources is decentralized, determined by the interactions of many self-interested buyers and sellers.
- Is the market’s allocation of resources desirable?   Or would a different allocation of resources make society better off?  
- To answer this, we use total surplus as a measure of society’s well-being, and we consider whether the market’s allocation is _efficient_.  (Policymakers also care about _equality_, though our focus here is on efficiency.)

## Efficiency
- An allocation of resources is **efficient** if it maximizes total surplus.  Efficiency means:
	- The goods are consumed by the buyers who value them most highly. 
	- The goods are produced by the producers with the lowest costs.
- Raising or lowering the quantity of a good would not increase total surplus. 

## Evaluating the Market Equilibrium
- Total surplus =  CS + PS
- Is the market eq’m efficient?

## Does Eq’m Q  Maximize Total Surplus?
- At **_Q_** = 20, the cost of producing the marginal unit is $35, and the value to the marginal unit's consumers is only $20. Hence, can increase the total surplus by reducing **_Q_**.  
- At Q = 10, the cost of producing the marginal unit is $25, and the value to the marginal unit's consumers is $40. Hence, can increase the total surplus by increasing **_Q_**.  
- The market  eq’m quantity maximizes total surplus:  
	- At any other quantity, can increase total surplus by moving toward the market eq’m quantity.

## The Free Market vs. Govt Intervention
- The market equilibrium is efficient.  No other outcome achieves a higher total surplus. 
- Govt cannot raise the total surplus by changing the market’s allocation of resources. 
- Laissez-faire (French for “allow them to do”): the notion that govt should not interfere with the market.

## The Free Market vs. Central Planning
- Suppose resources were allocated not by the market, but by a central planner who cares about society’s well-being. 
- To allocate resources efficiently and maximize total surplus, the planner needs to know every seller’s cost and every buyer’s WTP for every good in the economy.
- This is impossible, and why centrally-planned economies are never very efficient.
