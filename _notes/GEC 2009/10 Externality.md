# Externality  

## Key Questions 
- What is an externality?
- Why do externalities make market outcomes inefficient? 
- What public policies aim to solve the problem of externalities?
- How can people sometimes solve the problem of externalities on their own?  
- Why do such private solutions not always work?  

## Introduction
- One type of market failure: **externality**, the uncompensated impact of one person’s actions on the well-being of a bystander.
- Externalities can be **negative** or **positive**, depending on whether the impact on bystanders is adverse or beneficial. 
- Self-interested buyers and sellers neglect the external costs or benefits of their actions, so the market outcome is not efficient.  

## Examples of Negative Externalities
- Air pollution from a factory
- The neighbor’s barking dog
- Late-night stereo blasting from the dorm room next to yours
- Noise pollution from construction projects
- Health risk to others from second-hand smoke
- Talking on cell phone while driving makes the roads less safe for others

## Analysis of a Negative Externality

PMC(Private Marginal Cost), SMC(Social Marginal Cost), MEC(Marginal External Cost), MB(Marginal Benefit)
- Market Equilibrium: $(Q^*, P^*)=(60,60)$
- Social Optimum: $(Q_S, P_S)=(50,70)$
- One Solution: Tax $20 per unit.

## “Internalizing the Externality”
- **Internalizing the externality**:  altering incentives so that people take account of the external effects of their actions
- In the example, tax on sellers makes sellers’ costs = social costs.
- When market participants must pay social costs, market eq’m = social optimum.  (Imposing the tax on buyers would achieve the same outcome; market **_Q_** would equal optimal **_Q_**.)

## Examples of Positive Externalities
- Being vaccinated against contagious diseases protects not only you, but people who visit the salad bar or produce section after you. 
- R&D creates knowledge others can use.
- People going to college raise the population’s education level, which reduces crime and improves government.

## Positive Externalities
- In the presence of a positive externality, the **social value** of a good includes
	- **private value** – the direct value to buyers
	- **external benefit** – the value of the positive impact on bystanders
- The socially optimal **_Q_** maximizes welfare:
	- At any lower **_Q_**, the social value of additional units exceeds their cost.
	- At any higher **_Q_**, the cost of the last unit exceeds its social value.

## Effects of Externalities:  Summary
- If negative externality
	- market quantity larger than socially desirable
- If positive externality
	- market quantity smaller than socially desirable
- To remedy the problem,  “internalize the externality”
	- tax goods with negative externalities
	- subsidize goods with positive externalities

## Public Policies Toward Externalities

 Two approaches:
- **Command-and-control policies** regulate behavior directly.  
	- Examples: 
		- limits on quantity of pollution emitted
		- requirements that firms adopt a particular technology to reduce emissions
		- 
- **Market-based policies** provide incentives so that private decision-makers will choose to solve the problem on their own.  
	- Examples:
		- corrective taxes and subsidies
		- tradable pollution permits

## Corrective Taxes & Subsidies
- **Corrective tax**:  a tax designed to induce private decision-makers to take account of the social costs that arise from a negative externality
- Also called **Pigouvian taxes** after Arthur Pigou (1877-1959).  
- The ideal corrective tax = external cost
- For activities with positive externalities, ideal corrective subsidy = external benefit
- Other taxes and subsidies distort incentives and move economy away from the social optimum.
- Corrective Taxes & Subsidies
	- align private incentives with society’s interests
	- make private decision-makers take into account the external costs and benefits of their actions
	- move economy toward a more efficient allocation of resources  
- Different firms have different costs of pollution abatement.  
- Efficient outcome:  Firms with the lowest abatement costs reduce pollution the most.    
- A pollution tax is efficient:
	- Firms with low abatement costs will reduce pollution to reduce their tax burden.
	- Firms with high abatement costs have greater willingness to pay tax.
- In contrast, a regulation requiring all firms to reduce pollution by a specific amount not efficient. 

## Corrective Taxes vs. Regulations
- Corrective taxes are better for the environment:
	- The corrective tax gives firms incentive to continue reducing pollution as long as the cost of doing so is less than the tax. 
	- If a cleaner technology becomes available, the tax gives firms an incentive to adopt it.
	- In contrast, firms have no incentive for further reduction beyond the level specified in a regulation. 

## Example of a Corrective Tax:  The Gas Tax
- The gas tax targets three negative externalities:
	- Congestion: The more you drive, the more you contribute to congestion.
	- Accidents: Larger vehicles cause more damage in an accident.
	- Pollution: Burning fossil fuels produces greenhouse gases.

## Tradable Pollution Permits
- A tradable pollution permits system reduces pollution at lower cost than regulation.   
	- Firms with low cost of reducing pollution do so and sell their unused permits.
	- Firms with high cost of reducing pollution buy permits.  
- Result:  Pollution reduction is concentrated among those firms with lowest costs.  

## Corrective Taxes vs. Tradable Pollution Permits
- Like most demand curves, firms’ demand for the ability to pollute is a downward-sloping function of the “price” of polluting.  
	- A corrective tax raises this price and thus reduces the quantity of pollution firms demand.
	- A tradable permit system restricts the supply of pollution rights and has the same effect as the tax.  
- When policymakers do not know the position of this demand curve, the permit system achieves pollution reduction targets more precisely.  

## Objections to the Economic Analysis of Pollution
- Some politicians and many environmentalists argue that no one should be able to “buy” the right to pollute, and cannot put a price on the environment.
- However, people face tradeoffs.  The value of clean air and water must be compared to their cost. 
- The market-based approach reduces the cost of environmental protection, so it should increase the public’s demand for a clean environment. 

## Private Solutions to Externalities
- Types of private solutions:
	- Moral codes and social sanctions, e.g._,_ the “Golden Rule”
	- Charities, e.g._,_ the Sierra Club
	- Contracts between market participants and the affected bystanders
- **The Coase theorem**:  If private parties can costlessly bargain over the allocation of resources, they can solve the externalities problem on their own.

## Why Private Solutions Do Not Always Work
1. Transaction costs**:   The costs parties incur in the process of agreeing to and following through on a bargain. These costs may make it impossible to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
2. Stubbornness: Even if a beneficial agreement is possible, each party may hold out for a better deal.
3. Coordination problems:  If # of parties are very large, coordinating them may be costly, difficult, or impossible.
