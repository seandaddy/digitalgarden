# Elasticity
## Key Idea
- What is elasticity?  What kinds of issues can elasticity help us understand?
- What is the price elasticity of demand?
- How is it related to the demand curve?
- How is it related to revenue & expenditure?
- What is the price elasticity of supply?
- How is it related to the supply curve?
- What are the income and cross-price elasticities of demand?

## Elasticity
- Basic idea: Elasticity measures how much one variable responds to changes in another variable.
- One type of elasticity measures how much demand for your websites will fall if you raise your price.
- Definition: Elasticity is a numerical measure of the responsiveness of Qd or Qs to one of its determinants.

## Price Elasticity of Demand
- $\epsilon = -\frac{\%\Delta Q_d}{\%\Delta P}$
- Price elasticity of demand measures how much Qd responds to a change in P.
- Along a D curve, P and Q move in opposite directions, which would make price elasticity negative.
- We will drop the minus sign and report all price elasticities as positive numbers.

## The Determinants of Price Elasticity: A Summary
- The price elasticity of demand depends on: 
- the extent to which close substitutes are available
- whether the good is a necessity or a luxury
- how broadly or narrowly the good is defined
- the time horizon—elasticity is higher in the long run than in the short run

## The Variety of Demand Curves
- The price elasticity of demand is closely related to the slope of the demand curve.
- Rule of thumb:
	- The flatter the curve, the bigger the elasticity.
	- The steeper the curve, the smaller the elasticity.

## Perfectly inelastic demand
- one extreme case
- $\epsilon = -\frac{\%\Delta Q_d}{\%\Delta P} = -\frac{0}{-10}=0$

## Inelastic demand
- \epsilon = -\frac{\%\Delta Q_d}{\%\Delta P} = -\frac{8}{-10}=0.8<1

## Perfectly elastic demand
-  the other extreme
- $\epsilon = -\frac{\%\Delta Q_d}{\%\Delta P} = -\frac{10}{-0}= \infty$

## Price Elasticity and Total Revenue
- If you raise your price from $200 to $250, would your revenue rise or fall?
- $TR = P \cdot Q$
- A price increase has two effects on revenue:
- Higher P means more revenue on each unit you sell.
- But you sell fewer units (lower Q), due to the law of demand.
- Which of these two effects is bigger?
>It depends on the price elasticity of demand.

## Elastic demand(elasticity = 1.8)
- If demand is elastic, then the price elasticity of demand  >  1, % change in Q  >  % change in P
- The fall in revenue from lower Q is greater than the increase in revenue from higher P, so revenue falls.

## Inelastic demand(elasticity = 0.82)
- If demand is inelastic, then the price elasticity of demand  <  1, % change in Q  <  % change in P
- The fall in revenue from lower Q is smaller than the increase in revenue from higher P, so revenue rises.

## Price Elasticity of Supply
- $\epsilon_s = \frac{\%\Delta Q_s}{\%\Delta P}$
- Price elasticity of supply measures how much Qs respond to a change in P.
- It measures sellers’ price sensitivity.

## The Variety of Supply Curves
- The slope of the supply curve is closely related to price elasticity of supply.
- Rule of thumb:
	- The flatter the curve, the bigger the elasticity.
	-  The steeper the curve, the smaller the elasticity.

## Perfectly inelastic
- one extreme
- $\epsilon_s = \frac{\%\Delta Q_d}{\%\Delta P} = \frac{0}{10}=0$

## The Determinants of Supply Elasticity
- The more easily sellers can change the quantity they produce, the greater the price elasticity of supply.
- For many goods, the price elasticity of supply is greater in the long run than in the short run, because firms can build new factories, or new firms may be able to enter the market.

## Income Elasticity
- Income elasticity of demand:  measures the response of Qd to a change in consumer income
- $\epsilon_I = \frac{\%\Delta Q_d}{\%\Delta I}$

## Cross Elasticity
- The cross elasticity of demand: measures the response of demand for one good to changes in the price of another good
- $\epsilon_c = \frac{\%\Delta Q_1}{\%\Delta P_2}$ 
- For substitutes, cross-price elasticity > 0, (e.g., an increase in the price of beef causes an increase in demand for chicken)
- For complements, cross-price elasticity < 0, (e.g., an increase in the price of computers causes a decrease in demand for software)
