# The Principles and Practice of  Economics

## Learning Objective

1. The Scope of Economics
2. Three Principles of Economics
   1. The First Principle of Economics: Optimization
   2. The Second Principle of Economics: Equilibrium
   3. The Third Principle of Economics: Empiricism
3. Is Economics Good for You?

## Key Ideas
- Economics is the study of people’s choices.
- The first principle of economics is that people try to optimize; they try to choose the best available option.
- The second principle of economics is that economic systems tend to be in equilibrium, a situation in which nobody would benefit by changing his or her own behavior.
- The third principle of economics is empiricism—analysis that uses data. Economists use data to test theories and to determine what is causing things to happen in the real world.

## Economics 

- Economists study 
human behavior 
- 
Choice - not money - is the unifying feature of all the things that economists study
- Economic Agent = Any group or individual that makes choices, such as consumers, firms, parents, politicians, etc.

> What area of your life is NOT covered by economics?

## Scarcity

- What does it mean if 
something is “scarce”?
- Scarce resources are things that people want, where the quantity that people want often exceeds the quantity that is available.
- Economics studies how agents make choices among scarce resources and how those choices affect society. 

## Positive vs. Normative Economics 

> How many pieces should each person have taken?

- Positive Economics : Some people took more than one and not everyone got a piece


- Normative economics : Each student should just take one so that everyone gets a piece

## Micro vs. Macroeconomics

- Microeconomics : 
The study of how individuals, firms, and governments make choices 
- Macroeconomics : The study of the whole economy

## Three Principles of Economics

- Optimization : making the best choice possible 
with given information
- Equilibrium : when everyone is optimizing; no 
one would be better off with a different choice
- Empiricism : using data to figure out answers to
 interesting questions

## Optimization

- Optimization : making the best choice possible
 with given information
- People don’t always succeed in optimizing - we are not calculating machines - but people generally try to optimize.

>  What is the optimal level of crime? 

> A. You want to buy a $20 book. If you drive 3 miles, you can buy it for $10. 
> B. You want to buy a $1,000 computer. If you drive 3 miles, you can buy it for $990.

## Equilibrium
- A situation in which no one benefits by changing his/her behavior
- What Does Equilibrium Really Mean?

## The Free Rider Problem

- Exists when an individual or group is able to enjoy the benefits of a situation without incurring the costs

> Which one is experiencing equilibrium?
>
> Is there an incentive for him to change his behavior?
>
> Is this an equilibrium?

## How do we deal with this Free Rider?

- Group needs to decide what is fair
- Some sort of pressure needs to be put on the free rider to get him to conform
  **Markets have no mechanism for deciding what is fair**
