# Public Goods and Common Resources

## Key Questions
- What are public goods?   
- What are common resources?   
- Why do markets generally fail to provide efficient amounts of these goods?
- How might the government improve market outcomes in the case of public goods or common resources?

## Introduction
- We consume many goods without paying:  parks, national defense, clean air & water.  
- When goods have no prices, the market forces that normally allocate resources are absent.
- The private market may fail to provide a socially efficient quantity of such goods.  

## Important Characteristics of Goods
- A good is **excludable** if a person can be prevented from using it.  
	- Excludable:  Hamburger
	- Not excludable:  FM radio signals, national defense
- A good is **rival in consumption** if one person’s use of it diminishes others’ use.  
	- Rival:  Sandwich
	- Not rival: An MP3 file of Kanye West’s latest single

## The Different Kinds of Goods
- **Private goods**:  excludable, rival in consumption. Example:  food
- **Public goods**:  not excludable, not rival. Example:  national defense
- **Common resources**:  rival but not excludable. Example:  fish in the ocean
- **Club goods**:  excludable but not rival. Example:  cable TV
- For example, externalities arise in public goods and common resources because something of value has no price.  
- So, private decisions about consumption and production can lead to an inefficient outcome.
- Public policy can potentially raise economic well-being.  

## Public Goods
- Public goods are difficult for private markets to provide because of the _free-rider problem_. 
- **Free rider**:  a person who receives the benefit of a good but avoids paying for it 
- If goods are not excludable, people have the incentive to be free riders, because firms cannot prevent non-payers from consuming the goods. 
- Result:  The good is not produced, even if buyers collectively value the good higher than the cost of providing it.  
- If the benefit of a public good exceeds the cost of providing it, govt should provide the good and pay for it with a tax on people who benefit. 
- Problem:  Measuring the benefit is usually difficult. 
- **Cost-benefit analysis**:  a study that compares the costs and benefits of providing a public good  
- Cost-benefit analyses are imprecise, so the efficient provision of public goods is more difficult than that of private goods.  

## Some Important Public Goods
- National Defense
- Knowledge created through basic research
- Fighting poverty

## Common Resources
- Like public goods, common resources are not excludable.
	- Cannot prevent free riders from using 
	- Little incentive for firms to provide
	- Role of govt:  seeing that they are provided
- Additional problem with common resources:  rival in consumption
	- Each person’s use reduces others’ ability to use
	- Role of govt:  ensuring they are not overused

## The Tragedy of the Commons
- A parable that illustrates why common resources get used more than is socially desirable.  
- Setting:  a medieval town where sheep graze on common land.  
- As the population grows, the # of sheep grows.  
- The amount of land is fixed, and the grass begins to disappear from overgrazing.  
- The private incentives (using the land for free) outweigh the social incentives (using it carefully).
- Result:  People can no longer raise sheep. 
- The tragedy is due to an externality: Allowing one’s flock to graze on the common land reduces its quality for other families.  
- People neglect this external cost, resulting in the overuse of the land.  

## Policy Options to Prevent Overconsumption of Common Resources
- Regulate the use of the resource
- Impose a corrective tax to internalize the externality
	- Examples:  hunting & fishing licenses, entrance fees for congested national parks
- Auction-off permits allow the use of the resource
	- Example:  spectrum auctions by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission
- If the resource is land, convert it to a private good by dividing and selling parcels to individuals

## Some Important Common Resources
- Clean air and water
- Congested roads
- Fish, whales, and other wildlife

## CONCLUSION
- Public goods tend to be under-provided, while common resources tend to be over-consumed. 
- These problems arise because property rights are not well-established:
	- Nobody owns the air, so no one can charge polluters.  Result:  too much pollution.
	- Nobody can charge people who benefit from national defense.  Result:  too little defense. 
- The govt can potentially solve these problems with appropriate policies.
