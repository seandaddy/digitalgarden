# Tax System

## Key Questions
- What are the largest sources of tax revenue?
- What are the efficiency costs of taxes?  
- How can we evaluate the equity of a tax system?

## Introduction
- **_A government can sometimes improve market outcomes._**
	- Providing public goods
	- Regulating the use of common resources
	- Remedying the effects of externalities
- To perform its many functions, the govt raises revenue through taxation.  
- A tax on a good reduces the market quantity of that good.
- The burden of a tax is shared between buyers and sellers depending on the price elasticities of demand and supply.
- A tax causes a deadweight loss.

- how tax revenue as a share of national income has changed over time
- how the tax revenues compared to other countries

## Taxes and Efficiency
- One tax system is more efficient than another if it raises the same amount of revenue at a smaller cost to taxpayers. 
- The costs to taxpayers include:
	- the tax payment itself
	- deadweight losses
	- administrative burden

## Deadweight Losses
- Taxes distort incentives - they cause people to allocate resources according to tax incentives rather than true costs and benefits.  
- The result:  a deadweight loss.   
  > The fall in taxpayers’ well-being exceeds the revenue the govt collects.  

## Income vs. Consumption Tax
- The income tax reduces the incentive to save:
	- If income tax rate = 25%, 8% interest rate = 6% after-tax interest rate.
	- The lost income compounds over time.  
- Some economists advocate taxing consumption instead of income. 
	- Would restore incentive to save.
	- Better for individuals’ retirement income security and long-run economic growth.
- Consumption tax-like provisions in the U.S. tax code include Individual Retirement Accounts, 401(k) plans.
	- People can put a limited amount of saving into such accounts.
	- The funds are not taxed until withdrawn at retirement.
- Europe’s Value-Added Tax (VAT) is like a consumption tax.  

## Administrative Burden
- Includes the time and money people spend to comply with tax laws
- Encourages the expenditure of resources on legal tax avoidance
	- e.g., hiring accountants to exploit “loopholes” to reduce one’s tax burden
- Is a type of deadweight loss
- Could be reduced if the tax code were simplified but would require removing loopholes, politically difficult

## Marginal vs. Average Tax Rates
- **Average tax rate**
	- total taxes paid divided by total income
	- measures the sacrifice a taxpayer makes
-  **Marginal tax rate**
	- the extra taxes paid on an additional dollar of income
	- measures the incentive effects of taxes on work effort, saving, etc.

## Lump-Sum Taxes
- A **lump-sum tax** is the same for every person
- Example:  lump-sum tax = $4,000/person
|  Income | Average tax rate | Marginal tax rate |
|:-------:|:----------------:|:-----------------:|
| $20,000 |        20%       |         0%        |
| $40,000 |        10%       |         0%        |
- A lump-sum tax is the most efficient tax:
	- Causes no deadweight loss : Does not distort incentives.
	- Minimal administrative burden : No need to hire accountants, keep track of receipts, etc.
- Yet, perceived as unfair:
	- In dollar terms, the poor pay as much as the rich.
	- Relative to income, the poor pay much more than the rich.

## Taxes and Equity
- Another goal of tax policy: equity - distributing the burden of taxes “fairly.”
- Agreeing on what is “fair” is much harder than agreeing on what is “efficient.”  
- Yet, there are several principles people apply to evaluate the equity of a tax system.

## The Benefits Principle
- **Benefits principle**:  the idea that people should pay taxes based on the benefits they receive from govt services
- Tries to make public goods similar to private goods—the more you use, the more you pay
- Example:  Gasoline taxes
	- Amount of tax paid is related to how much a person uses public roads

## The Ability-To-Pay Principle
- **Ability-to-pay principle**:  the idea that taxes should be levied on a person according to how well that person can shoulder the burden
- Suggests that all taxpayers should make an “equal sacrifice”
- Recognizes that the magnitude of the sacrifice depends not just on the tax payment, but on the person’s income and other circumstances
	- A $10,000 tax bill is a bigger sacrifice for a poor person than a rich person

## Vertical Equity
- **Vertical equity**:  the idea that taxpayers with a greater ability to pay taxes should pay larger amounts
-  Three Tax Systems
	- **Proportional tax**: Taxpayers pay the same fraction of income, regardless of income
	- **Regressive tax**: High-income taxpayers pay a smaller fraction of their income than low-income taxpayers
	- **Progressive tax**: High-income taxpayers pay a larger fraction of their income than low-income taxpayers

-  Examples of the Three Tax Systems
|          |Regressive  |             | Proportional |             | Progressive |             |
|:--------:|:----------:|:-----------:|:------------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
|  income  |     tax    | % of income |      tax     | % of income |     tax     | % of income |
|  $50,000 |   $15,000  |     30%     |    $12,500   |     25%     |   $10,000   |     20%     |
| $100,000 |   $25,000  |     25%     |    $25,000   |     25%     |   $25,000   |     25%     |
| $200,000 |   $40,000  |     20%     |    $50,000   |     25%     |   $60,000   |     30%     |

## Horizontal Equity
- **Horizontal equity**:  the idea that taxpayers with similar abilities to pay taxes should pay the same amount
- Problem: Difficult to agree on what factors, besides income, determine the ability to pay.

## Marriage Taxes and Subsidies
- Couples with similar incomes are likely to pay a marriage tax
- Couples with very different incomes are likely to receive a marriage subsidy
- Many have advocated reforming the tax system to be neutral with respect to marital status.
- The ideal tax system would have these properties:
	- Two married couples with the same total income pay the same tax.
	- Marital status does not affect a couple’s tax bill.
	- A person/family with no income pays no taxes.
- High-income taxpayers pay a higher fraction of their incomes than low-income taxpayers.
> However, designing a tax system with all four of these properties is mathematically impossible.  

## Tax Incidence and Tax Equity
- Recall:  The person who bears the burden is not always the person who gets the tax bill.
- Example:  A tax on fur coats
	- May appear to be vertically equitable
	- But furs are a luxury with very elastic demand
	- The tax shifts demand away from furs, hurting the people who produce furs  (who probably are not rich) 
- Lesson:  When evaluating tax equity, must take tax incidence into account.  

## Who Pays the Corporate Income Tax?
- When the govt levies a tax on a corporation, the corporation is more like a tax collector than a taxpayer. 
- The burden of the tax ultimately falls on people.
- Suppose govt levies a tax on automakers.
	- Owners receive less profit, may respond over time by shifting their wealth out of the auto industry.
	- The supply of cars falls, car prices rise, car buyers are worse off.
	- Demand for auto workers falls, wages fall, workers are worse off.

## Flat Taxes
- **Flat tax**:  a tax system under which the marginal tax rate is the same for all taxpayers
- Typically, income above a certain threshold is taxed at a constant rate
- The higher the threshold, the more progressive the tax
- Sharply reduces administrative burden
- Not popular with 
	- people who benefit from the complexity of the current system (accountants, lobbyists) 
	- people who can’t imagine life without their favorite deduction/loophole
- Used in some central/eastern European countries

## CONCLUSION:  **The Trade-Off Between Efficiency and Equity**
- The goals of efficiency and equity often conflict:
	- e.g., lump-sum tax is the least equitable but most efficient tax. 
- Political leaders differ in their views on this tradeoff. 
- Economics
	- can help us better understand the tradeoff
	- can help us avoid policies that sacrifice efficiency without any increase in equity
