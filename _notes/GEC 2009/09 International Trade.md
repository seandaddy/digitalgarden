# International Trade
 
## Key Questions
- What determines how much of a good a country will import or export?  
- Who benefits from trade?  Who does trade harm?  Do the gains outweigh the losses? 
- If policymakers restrict imports, who benefits?   
- Who is harmed?  Do the gains from restricting imports outweigh the losses?  
- What are some common arguments for restricting trade?  Do they have merit?

## Introduction
- A country has a **comparative advantage** in a good if it produces the good at lower opportunity cost than other countries.  
- Countries can gain from trade if each exports the goods in which it has a comparative advantage. 
- Now we apply the tools of welfare economics to see where these gains come from and who gets them.  

## The World Price and Comparative Advantage
- $P_W$ = the **world price** of a good,  the price that prevails in world markets 
- $P_D$ = domestic price without trade 
- If  $P_D < P_W$, country has comparative advantage in the good under free trade, country exports the good
- If  $P_D > P_W$, country does not have comparative advantage under free trade, country imports the good

## The Small Economy Assumption
- A small economy is a **price taker** in world markets:  Its actions have no effect on  $P_W$.  
- When a small economy engages in free trade, $P_W$ is the only relevant price:  
- No seller would accept less than $P_W$, since she could sell the good for $P_W$ in world markets. 
- No buyer would pay more than $P_W$, since he could buy the good for $P_W$ in world markets. 

## A Country That Exports Soybeans
- Without trade, $CS = A + B, PS = C, TS= A + B + C$
- With trade, $CS = A, PS = B + C + D, TS= A + B + C + D$

## Other Benefits of International Trade
- Consumers enjoy increased variety of goods.
- Producers sell to a larger market, may achieve lower costs by producing on a larger scale.
- Competition from abroad may reduce market power of domestic firms, which would increase  total welfare.
- Trade enhances the flow of ideas, facilitates the spread of technology around the world.

## Then Why All the Opposition to Trade?
- The winners from trade could compensate the losers and still be better off. Yet, such compensation rarely occurs.
- The losses are often highly concentrated among a small group of people, who feel them acutely.  
- The gains are often spread thinly over many people, who may not see how trade benefits them.
- Hence, the losers have more incentive to organize and lobby for restrictions on trade. 

## Tariff:  An Example of a Trade Restriction
- **Tariff**:  a tax on imports  
- Free Trade : $CS = A + B + C  + D + E + F, PS = G, TS= A + B+ C + D + E + F + G$
- Tariff : $CS = A + B, PS = C + G, TR = E, TS = A + B  + C + E + G$

## Import Quotas:  Another Way to Restrict Trade
- An **import quota** is a quantitative limit on imports of a good. 
- Mostly has the same effects as a tariff:
	- Raises price, reduces quantity of imports.
	- Reduces buyers’ welfare.
	- Increases sellers’ welfare.
- A tariff creates revenue for the govt.  A quota creates profits for the foreign producers of the imported goods, who can sell them at higher price.  
- Or, govt could auction licenses to import to capture this profit as revenue.  Usually it does not. 

## Arguments for Restricting Trade
1. The jobs argument
- Trade destroys jobs in industries that compete with imports. 
	- **_Economists’ response:_**
		- Look at the data to see whether rising imports cause rising unemployment
2. The national security argument
- An industry vital to national security should be protected from foreign competition, to prevent dependence on imports that could be disrupted during wartime.
	- **_Economists’ response:_**
		- Fine, as long as we base policy on true security needs. 
		- But producers may exaggerate their own importance to national security to obtain protection from foreign competition.   
3. The infant-industry argument
- A new industry argues for temporary protection until it is mature and can compete with foreign firms. 
	- **_Economists’ response:_**
		- Difficult for govt to determine which industries will eventually be able to compete and whether benefits of establishing these industries exceed cost to consumers of restricting imports.  
		- Besides, if a firm will be profitable in the long run, it should be willing to incur temporary losses. 
4. The unfair-competition argument
- Producers argue their competitors in another country have an unfair advantage,  e.g. due to govt subsidies. 
	- **_Economists’ response:_**
		- Great!  Then we can import extra-cheap products subsidized by the other country’s taxpayers.  
		- The gains to our consumers will exceed the losses to our producers.  
5. The protection-as-bargaining-chip argument
- Example:  The U.S. can threaten to limit imports of French wine unless France lifts their quotas on American beef.  
	- **_Economists’ response:_**
		- Suppose France refuses.  Then the U.S. must choose between two bad options:  
			- A) Restrict imports from France, which reduces welfare in the U.S.
			- B) Don’t restrict imports, which reduces U.S. credibility. 

## Trade Agreements
- A country can liberalize trade with unilateral reductions in trade restrictions multilateral agreements with other nations 
- Examples of trade agreements:  
	- North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), 1993
	- General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), ongoing World Trade Organization (WTO), est. 1995, enforces trade agreements, resolves disputes
