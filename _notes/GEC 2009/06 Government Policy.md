# Government Policy
## Key Questions
- What are price ceilings and price floors?   
- What are some examples of each?  
- How do price ceilings and price floors affect market outcomes?  
- How do taxes affect market outcomes?  
- How do the effects depend on whether the tax is imposed on buyers or sellers? 
- What is the incidence of a tax? 
- What determines the incidence? 

## Government Policies
- Price controls
	- **Price ceiling**:  a legal maximum on the price of a good or service. Example: rent control 
	- **Price floor**:  a legal minimum on the price of a good or service. Example: minimum wage
 - Taxes
	 - The government can make buyers or sellers pay a specific amount on each unit.

## Price Ceiling
- A price ceiling above the eq’m price is **not binding** - has no effect on the market outcome.  
- The ceiling is a **binding constraint** on the price, causes a shortage.

- In the long run, supply and demand are more price-elastic. 
- So, the shortage is larger. 

## Shortages and Rationing
- With a shortage, sellers must ration the goods among buyers.  
- Some rationing mechanisms:   (1) Long lines (2) Discrimination according to sellers’ biases
- These mechanisms are often unfair, and inefficient:  the goods do not necessarily go to the buyers who value them most highly. 
- In contrast, when prices are not controlled, the rationing mechanism is efficient (the goods go to the buyers that value them most highly) and impersonal (and thus fair). 
  ## Price Floor 
- A price floor below the eq’m price is **not binding** – has no effect on the market outcome.  
- The floor is a **binding constraint** on the wage, causes a surplus (i.e._,_ unemployment).

## The Minimum Wage
- Min wage laws do not affect highly skilled workers. 
- They do affect teen workers.  
	- Studies: A 10% increase in the min wage raises teen unemployment by 1–3%. 

## Evaluating Price Controls
- Prices are the signals that guide the allocation of society’s resources. This allocation is altered when policymakers restrict prices. 
- Price controls often intended to help the poor, but often hurt more than help. 

## Taxes
- The govt levies taxes on many goods & services to raise revenue to pay for national defense, public schools, etc. 
- The govt can make buyers or sellers pay the tax. 
- The tax can be a % of the good’s price, or a specific amount for each unit sold.  
## A Tax on Buyers
- Effects of a $1.50 per unit tax on buyers.
- A tax on buyers shifts the demand curve down by the amount of the tax.

## A Tax on Sellers
- Effects of a $1.50 per unit tax on sellers.
- A tax on sellers shifts the supply curve up by the amount of the tax.

## The **Incidence** of a Tax
- how the burden of a tax is shared among market participants
- The outcome is the same in both cases
- What matters is this : A tax drives a wedge between the price buyers pay and the price sellers receive.

## Elasticity and Tax Incidence
- CASE 1:  Supply is more elastic than demand

- CASE 2:  Demand is more elastic than supply
