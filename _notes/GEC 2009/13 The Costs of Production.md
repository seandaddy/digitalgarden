# The Cost of Production

## Key questions
- What is a production function?  What is the marginal product?  How are they related? 
- What are the various costs, and how are they related to each other and to output?
- How are costs different in the short run vs. the long run?  
- What are “economies of scale”?

## Total Revenue, Total Cost, Profit
- We assume that the firm’s goal is to maximize profit.
> $\pi = TR - TC,$
> where, $\pi$ is the profit, TR is the total revenue, and TC is the total cost.
> The total revenue measures the amount a firm receives from the sale of its output and the total cost does the market value of the inputs a firm uses in production.

## Costs:  Explicit vs. Implicit
- **Explicit costs** require an outlay of money, e.g., paying wages to workers.
- **Implicit costs** do not require a cash outlay, e.g., the opportunity cost of the owner’s time.
- Remember **_The cost of something is what you give up to get it_.** 

## Explicit vs. Implicit Costs:  An Example
- You need $\$100,000$ to start your business. Suppose the interest rate is $5\%$. 
> Case 1:  borrow $100,000
> explicit cost = $5000 interest on loan

> Case 2:  use $40,000 of your savings, borrow the other $60,000
> explicit cost = $3000 (5%) interest on the loan
> implicit cost = $2000 (5%) _foregone_ interest you could have earned on your $40,000.

## Economic Profit  vs. Accounting Profit
- **Accounting profit** = total revenue minus total explicit costs
- **Economic profit**= total revenue minus total costs (including explicit and implicit costs)
- Accounting profit ignores implicit costs, so it’s higher than economic profit.  
# The Production Function
- A **production function** shows the relationship between the quantity of inputs used to produce a good and the quantity of output of that good. 
- It can be represented by a table, equation, or graph.  

## EXAMPLE 1:  Farmer Jack’s Production Function
- Farmer Jack grows wheat. He has 5 acres of land. He can hire as many workers as he wants.

## Marginal Product
- If Jack hires one more worker, his output rises by the _marginal product of labor_. 
- The **marginal product** of any input is the increase in output arising from an additional unit of that input, holding all other inputs constant. 
- Notation:  $\Delta$ (delta) = “change in…”
- $\Delta Q=$ change in output, $\Delta L=$ change in labor
- Marginal product of labor, $MP_L = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta L}$ 

## Why MPL Is Important
- When Farmer Jack hires an extra worker, 
	- his costs rise by the wage he pays the worker
	- his output rises by $MP_L$
- Comparing them helps Jack decide whether he should hire the worker.  

## Why MPL Diminishes
- Farmer Jack’s output rises by a smaller and smaller amount for each additional worker.  Why? 
- As Jack adds workers, the average worker has less land to work with and will be less productive.  
- In general, _MPL_ diminishes as **_L_** rises whether the fixed input is land or capital (equipment, machines, etc.)
- **Diminishing marginal product**:  the marginal product of an input declines as the quantity of the input increases (other things equal)

## EXAMPLE 1: Farmer Jack’s Costs
- Farmer Jack must pay $1,000 per month for the land, regardless of how much wheat he grows. The market wage for a farm worker is $2,000 per month.  
|L|Q|Cost of Land|Cost of Labor|TC|
|:--:|:--:|--:|--:|--:|
|0|0|$1,000|$0|$1,000|
|1|1,000|$1,000|$2,000|$3,000|
|2|1,800|$1,000|$4,000|$5,000|
|3|2,400|$1,000|$6,000|$7,000|
|4|2,800|$1,000|$8,000|$9,000|
|5|3,000|$1,000|$10,000|$11,000|

## Marginal Cost
- **Marginal Cost** (_MC_) is the increase in Total Cost from producing one more unit: $MC = \frac{\Delta TC}{\Delta Q}$
![[Screenshot 2022-11-22 at 3.19.36 PM.png|300]]
  
## Why MC Is Important
- Farmer Jack is rational and wants to maximize his profit.  To increase profit, should he produce more or less wheat?  
- To find the answer, Farmer Jack needs to “think at the margin.”  
- If the cost of additional wheat (_MC_) is less than the revenue he would get from selling it, then Jack’s profits rise if he produces more. 

## Fixed and Variable Costs
- **Fixed costs** **(_FC_)** do not vary with the quantity of output produced.  
	- For Farmer Jack, $FC = \$1,000$ for his land
	- Other examples: cost of equipment, loan payments, rent
- **Variable costs (_VC_)** vary with the quantity produced.  
	- For Farmer Jack, $VC =$ wages he pays workers
	- Another example is the cost of materials
- $TC=FC+VC$

## EXAMPLE 2: Total Cost

## EXAMPLE 2: Average Total Cost
- Average total cost(ATC) equals total cost divided by the quantity of output:
   $ATC = \frac{TC}{Q}, ATC=AFC+AVC, \because \frac{TC}{Q}= \frac{AFC}{Q}+\frac{AVC}{Q}$

| Q |  TC  |  ATC  |  AFC  |  AVC  |
|:-:|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| 0 | $100 |       |       |       |
| 1 |  170 |  $170 |  $100 |  $70  |
| 2 |  220 |  110  |   50  |   60  |
| 3 |  260 | 86.67 | 33.33 | 53.33 |
| 4 |  310 |  77.5 |   25  |  52.5 |
| 5 |  380 |   76  |   20  |   56  |
| 6 |  480 |   80  | 16.67 | 63.33 |
| 7 |  620 | 88.57 | 14.29 | 74.29 |

## EXAMPLE 2: The Various Cost Curves Together

## Costs in the Short Run & Long Run
- Short run: Some inputs are fixed (e.g._,_ factories, land). The costs of these inputs are _FC_.
- Long run: All inputs are variable (e.g._,_ firms can build more factories, or sell existing ones).
- In the long run, _ATC_ at any **_Q_** is cost per unit using the most efficient mix of inputs for that **_Q_** (e.g., the factory size with the lowest _ATC_).

EXAMPLE 3: LRATC with 3 factory sizes
- Firm can choose from three factory sizes:  S, M, L. 
- Each size has its own SRATC curve. 
- The firm can change to a different factory size in the long run, but not in the short run.

## How ATC Changes as the Scale of Production Changes
- Economies of scale:  ATC falls as Q increases.
- Constant returns to scale:  ATC stays the same as Q increases.
- Diseconomies of scale:  ATC rises as Q increases.
