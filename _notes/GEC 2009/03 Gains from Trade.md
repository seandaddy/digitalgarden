# Gains from Trade
## Key Idea
- How can trade make everyone better off?
	- What is absolute advantage?   
	- What is comparative advantage?   
	- How are these concepts similar?   
	- How are they different? 

## Our Model
- Two countries:  the U.S. and Korea
- Two goods:  computers and wheat
- One resource:  labor, measured in hours 

> We will look at how much of both goods each country produces and consumes
> 	if the country chooses to be self-sufficient
> 	if it trades with the other country

## Production Possibilities in the U.S.
- The U.S. has 50,000 hours of labor available for production, per month.  
- Producing one computer requires 100 hours of labor. 
- Producing one ton of wheat requires 10 hours of labor.  

## The U.S. PPF

## Production Possibilities in Korea
- Korea has 30,000 hours of labor available for production, per month.
- Producing one computer requires 125 hours of labor.  
- Producing one ton of wheat requires 25 hours of labor.

## Korea PPF

## Consumption With and Without Trade
- Without trade, 
	- U.S. consumers get 250 computers and 2500 tons wheat.
	- Korea consumers get 120 computers and 600 tons wheat.
- We will compare consumption without trade to consumption with trade. 

## Exports & Imports
- **Exports**: goods produced domestically and sold abroad
	- **To export** means to sell domestically produced goods abroad.
- **Imports**: goods produced abroad and sold domestically
	- **To import** means to purchase goods produced in other countries.  

## Trade Example
- Suppose the U.S. produces 3,400 tons of wheat.
- Suppose Korea Produces 240 computers.
- Suppose the U.S. exports 700 tons of wheat to Korea, and imports 110 computers from Korea.

## Where Do These Gains Come From?
- **Absolute advantage**:  the ability to produce a good using fewer inputs than another producer  
- The U.S. has an absolute advantage in wheat: producing a ton of wheat uses 10 labor hours in the U.S. vs. 25 in Korea.  
- If each country has an absolute advantage in one good and specializes in that good, then both countries can gain from trade.  
- Which country has an absolute advantage in computers?  
- Producing one computer requires 125 labor hours in Korea, but only 100 in the U.S.
- The U.S. has an absolute advantage in both goods!
> Why does Korea specialize in computers? Why do both countries gain from trade? 

## Two Measures of the Cost of a Good
- Two countries can gain from trade when each specializes in the goods it produces at the lowest cost. 
- Absolute advantage measures the cost of a good in terms of the inputs required to produce it. 
> In our example, the opportunity cost of a computer is the amount of wheat that could be produced using the labor needed to produce one computer. 

## Opportunity Cost and  Comparative Advantage
- **Comparative advantage**:  the ability to produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another producer
- Which country has the comparative advantage in computers?  
- The opportunity cost of a computer is 10 tons of wheat in the U.S., because producing one computer requires 100 labor hours, which instead could produce 10 tons of wheat.
- 5 tons of wheat in Korea, because producing one computer requires 125 labor hours, which instead could produce 5 tons of wheat. So, Japan has a comparative advantage in computers. 

## Comparative Advantage and Trade
- Gains from trade arise from comparative advantage. 
- When each country specializes in the goods in which it has a comparative advantage, total production in all countries is higher, the world’s “economic pie” is bigger, and all countries can gain from trade.  

## SUMMARY
- Comparative advantage means being able to produce a good at a lower opportunity cost.  Absolute advantage means being able to produce a good with fewer inputs.  
- When people—or countries—specialize in the goods in which they have a comparative advantage, the economic “pie” grows and trade can make everyone better off.
