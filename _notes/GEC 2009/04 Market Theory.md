# Market Theory
## Key Idea 
- What factors affect buyers’ demand for goods?
- What factors affect sellers’ supply of goods? 
- How do supply and demand determine the price of a good and the quantity sold?
- How do changes in the factors that affect demand or supply affect the market price and quantity of a good?  
- How do markets allocate resources?

## Markets and Competition
- A **market** is a group of buyers and sellers of a particular product. 
- A **competitive market** is one with many buyers and sellers, each has a negligible effect on price. 
- In a **perfectly competitive** market:
	- All goods exactly the same
	- Buyers & sellers so numerous that no one can affect market price—each is a “**price taker**”
	- In this chapter, we assume markets are perfectly competitive.  

## Demand
- The **quantity demanded** of any good is the amount of the good that buyers are willing and able to purchase. 
- **Law of demand**:  the claim that the quantity demanded of a good falls when the price of the good rises, other things equal  

## The Demand Schedule
- **Demand schedule**: a table that shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded

## Market Demand versus Individual Demand
- The quantity demanded in the market is the sum of the quantities demanded by all buyers at each price. 
- Suppose Helen and Ken are the only two buyers in the Latte market.

## Demand Curve Shifters
- The demand curve shows how price affects the quantity demanded, _other things being equal_. 
- These “other things” are non-price determinants of demand (i.e._,_ things that determine buyers’ demand for a good, other than the good’s price).  
- Changes in them shift the **_D_** curve (# of Buyers, Income, Prices of Related Goods)

### Income
- Demand for a **normal good** is positively related to income.  
- An increase in income causes an increase in quantity demanded at each price, shifting the **_D_** curve to the right.  
- Demand for an **inferior good** is negatively related to income.  An increase in income shifts **_D_** curves for inferior goods to the left.

### Prices of Related Goods
- Two goods are **substitutes** if an increase in the price of one causes an increase in demand for the other. 
	- Example:  pizza and hamburgers. An increase in the price of pizza increases the demand for hamburgers, shifting the demand curve to the right.  
- Two goods are **complements** if an increase in the price of one causes a fall in demand for the other.  
	- Example:  computers and software. If the price of computers rises, people buy fewer computers and therefore less software.  The software demand curve shifts left. 

### Tastes
- Anything that causes a shift in tastes _toward_ a good will increase demand for that good and shift its **_D_** curve to the right.
	- Example:  The Atkins diet became popular in the ’90s, caused an increase in demand for eggs, and shifted the egg demand curve to the right.  

### Expectations
- Expectations affect consumers’ buying decisions.
	- Examples:  
		- If people expect their incomes to rise, their demand for meals at expensive restaurants may increase now.
		- If the economy sours and people worry about their future job security, demand for new autos may fall now.  

## Supply
- The **quantity supplied** of any good is the amount that sellers are willing and able to sell. 
- **Law of supply**:  the claim that the quantity supplied of a good rises when the price of the good rises, other things equal  

## The Supply Schedule
- Supply schedule: A table that shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied.

## Market Supply versus Individual Supply
- The quantity supplied in the market is the sum of the quantities supplied by all sellers at each price.

## Supply Curve Shifters
- The supply curve shows how price affects quantity supplied, _other things being equal_. 
- These “other things” are non-price determinants of supply.  
- Changes in them shift the **_S_** curve… 

### Input Prices
- Examples of input prices: wages, and prices of raw materials.
	- A fall in input prices makes production more profitable at each output price,  so firms supply a larger quantity at each price and the **_S_** curve shifts to the right. 

### Technology
- Technology determines how much inputs are required to produce a unit of output.  
- A cost-saving technological improvement has the same effect as a fall in input prices, shifts **_S_** curve to the right.  

### Number of Sellers
- An increase in the number of sellers increases the quantity supplied at each price, shifts **_S_** curve to the right.  

### Expectations
- Example: Events in the Middle East lead to expectations of higher oil prices.  
	- In response, owners of Texas oilfields reduce supply now, save some inventory to sell later at the higher price. **_S_** curve shifts left.  
	- In general, sellers may adjust supply* when their expectations of future prices change. (*_If good not perishable_)

## Supply and Demand Together

## Surplus(excessive supply)

## Shortage(excessive demand)

## Three Steps to Analyzing Changes in Eq’m
- To determine the effects of any event, 
1. Decide whether the event shifts **_S_** curve, **_D_** curve, or both. 
2. Decide in which direction the curve shifts. 
3. Use the supply-demand diagram to see how the shift changes eq’m **_P_** and **_Q_**. 

## EXAMPLE 1: The Market for Hybrid Cars  
- Increase in the price of gas.

## Terms for Shift vs. Movement Along Curve
- **Change in supply**:  a shift in the **_S_** curve occurs when a non-price determinant of supply changes (like technology or costs)
- **Change in the quantity supplied**: a movement along a fixed **_S_** curve occurs when **_P_** changes  
- **Change in demand**:  a shift in the **_D_** curve occurs when a non-price determinant of demand changes (like income or # of buyers)
- **Change in the quantity demanded**: a movement along a fixed **_D_** curve occurs when P changes 

## EXAMPLE  2:  A Shift in Supply  
- New technology reduces the cost of producing hybrid cars.

## How Prices Allocate Resources
- **_Markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity._** 
- In market economies, prices adjust to balance supply and demand.  These equilibrium prices are the signals that guide economic decisions and thereby allocate scarce resources.
