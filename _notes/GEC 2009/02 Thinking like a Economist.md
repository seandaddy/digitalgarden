# Thinking lika a Economist

## Key Idea
- What are economists’ two roles?  How do they differ? 
- What are models?  How do economists use them?
- What are the elements of the Circular-Flow Diagram?  What concepts does the diagram illustrate?  
- How is the Production Possibilities Frontier related to opportunity cost?

## The Economist as Scientist
- Economists play two roles:
	- Scientists:  try to explain the world
	- Policy advisors:  try to improve it

## Assumptions & Models
- Assumptions simplify the complex world, make it easier to understand.  
- Model:  a highly simplified representation of a more complicated reality.   Economists use models to study economic issues.  

## Our First Model: The Circular-Flow Diagram
- The **Circular-Flow Diagram**:  a visual model of the economy, shows how dollars flow through markets among households and firms

## **Our Second Model:** **The Production Possibilities Frontier**
- The **Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)**:  a graph that shows the combinations of  two goods the economy can possibly produce given the available resources and the available technology

**A.** On the graph, find the point that represents (100 computers, 3000 tons of wheat), label it **F**. Would it be possible for the economy to produce this combination of the two goods? Why or why not?  

**B.** Next, find the point that represents (300 computers, 3500 tons of wheat), label it **G**.  Would it be possible for the economy to produce this combination of the two goods?

## The PPF and Opportunity Cost
- Moving along a PPF involves shifting resources (e.g., labor) from the production of one good to the other.   
- Society faces a tradeoff:  Getting more of one good requires sacrificing some of the other.  
- The slope of the PPF tells you the opportunity cost of one good in terms of the other. 
- The slope of a line equals the  “**rise** over the **run**,” the amount the line rises when you move to the right by one unit.

## Economic Growth and the PPF
- With additional resources or an improvement in technology, the economy can produce more computers, more wheat, or any combination in between

## The Shape of the PPF
- The PPF could be a straight line or bow-shaped 
- Depends on what happens to opportunity cost as economy shifts resources from one industry to the other.
	- If opp. cost remains constant, PPF is a straight line.  
	- If opp. cost of a good rises as the economy produces more of the good, PPF is bow-shaped.  
## Why the PPF Might Be Bow-Shaped
- As the economy shifts resources from beer to mountain bikes:
	- PPF becomes steeper
	- Opportunity cost of mountain bikes increases

## The PPF Summary
- The PPF shows all combinations of two goods that an economy can possibly produce,  given its resources and technology. 
- The PPF illustrates the concepts of tradeoff and opportunity cost,  
efficiency and inefficiency, unemployment, and economic growth.
- A bow-shaped PPF illustrates the concept of increasing opportunity cost.
## The Economist as Policy Advisor
- As scientists, economists make **positive statements**, which attempt to describe the world as it is.
- As policy advisors, economists make **normative statements**, which attempt to prescribe how the world should be.  
- Positive statements can be confirmed or refuted, normative statements cannot. 
## **SUMMARY**
- As scientists, economists try to explain the world using models with appropriate assumptions.  
- Two simple models are the Circular-Flow Diagram and the Production Possibilities Frontier. 
- As policy advisers, economists offer advice on how to improve the world.
