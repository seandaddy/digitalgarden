# The Cost of Taxation
  
## Key Questions
- How does a tax affect consumer surplus, producer surplus, and total surplus?  
- What is the _deadweight loss_ of a tax? 
- What factors determine the size of this deadweight loss?  
- How does tax revenue depend on the size of the tax?

## The Effects of a Tax
- We apply welfare economics to measure the gains and losses from a tax. 
- We determine consumer surplus (CS), producer surplus (PS), tax revenue, and total surplus with and without the tax. 
- Tax revenue can fund beneficial services (e.g., education, roads, police), so we include it in total surplus.

- Without a tax, $CS=A+B+C, PS=D+E+F, TR=0, TS=CS+PS=A+B+C+D+E+F.$
- With a tax, $CS=A, PS=F, TR=B+D, TS=CS+PS+TR=A+B+D+F.$
- The tax reduces $TS$ by $C+E$, which is called the deadweight loss(DWL) of the tax. The fall in total surpuls results from a market distortion, such as a tax.

## What Determines the Size of the DWL?
- Which goods or services should govt tax to raise the revenue it needs? 
- One answer:  those with the smallest DWL.  
- When is the DWL small vs. large? 
	- Turns out it depends on the price elasticities of supply and demand.  

## DWL and the Elasticity of Supply
- When supply is inelastic, it’s harder for firms to leave the market when the tax reduces $P_S.$ So, the tax only reduces $Q$ a little, and DWL is small.

- The more elastic is supply, the easier for firms to leave the market when the tax reduces $P_S,$ the greater $Q$ falls below the surplus-maximizing quantity, the greater the $DWL.$

## DWL and the Elasticity of Demand
- When demand is inelastic, it’s harder for consumers to leave the market when the tax raises $P_B.$ So, the tax only reduces $Q$ a little, and $DWL$ is small.

- The more elastic is demand, the easier for buyers to leave the market when the tax increases $P_B,$ the more $Q$ falls below the surplus-maximizing quantity, and the greater the $DWL.$

## How Big Should the Government Be?
- A bigger government provides more services, but requires higher taxes, which cause $DWL$s. 
- The larger the $DWL$ from taxation, the greater the argument for smaller government.  
- The tax on labor income is especially important; it’s the biggest source of govt revenue.  
- For the typical worker, the **_marginal tax rate_**(the tax on the last dollar of earnings) is about 40%.  
- How big is the $DWL$ from this tax? It depends on elasticity.
- If labor supply is inelastic, then this $DWL$ is small.  
- Some economists believe labor supply is inelastic, arguing that most workers work full-time regardless of the wage.  
- Other economists believe labor taxes are highly distorting because some groups of workers have elastic supply and can respond to incentives:
	- Many workers can adjust their hours, e.g., by working overtime.
	- Many families have a 2nd earner with discretion over whether and how much to work.  
	- Many elderly choose when to retire based on the wage they earn.
	- Some people work in the “underground economy” to evade high taxes.
